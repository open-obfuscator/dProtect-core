dProtected-Core is a fork of [ProguardCORE](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard-core) for the needs
of dProtect. You can find the details about ProguardCORE in the original [README](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard-core/blob/master/README.md) and
the official website: https://guardsquare.github.io/proguard-core/

This fork tries to minimize as much as possible the modifications in the code of Proguard. For this purpose most of the
code is located in the [dprotect](https://github.com/open-obfuscator/dprotect-core/tree/dprotect/base/src/main/java/dprotect) package.
